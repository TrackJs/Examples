    This is an example of bundling several scripts together.  On page load we do some things that result in an error.  Check out your console.
    <script>
    	// Make sure things work.
    	trackJs.track("This is a gulp bundle example!");

    	// There is a bug in this code that will cause an error to be tracked.
    	var car = new Car("Tesla", "Model S");
    	car.drive();
