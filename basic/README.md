### Basic TrackJS example
This is a very simple example with no other configuration options other than the token being specified.  This is a good first start, though we recommend checking out the other, more advanced, examples for real world usage.

#### Running the example

Be sure to set your token on the configuration object in `index.html`.

```bash 
# if it's not already installed
npm install -g http-server

http-server .
# Load http://localhost:8080 in your browser

```
